\exercise{
	Let $d$ be a non square integer.
	We study the equation 
	\begin{align}\label{eq:1} x^2 - dy^2 = k \end{align}
	for integers $N$.

	Recall that if $\alpha = x + y\sqrt{d} \in \Z[\sqrt{d}]$ has norm equal to $k$, then $(x,y)$ is a solution to \eqref{eq:1}.
	Further, for any element $\epsilon = u + v \sqrt{d} \in \N_+[\sqrt{d}]$ such that $N(\epsilon)=1$, then $\alpha \cdot \epsilon$ gives a solution to \eqref{eq:1} as well.

	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item Assume that $x > 0$. Show that, up to inverting $\epsilon$, one has $v \cdot y < 0$, and that
			\[ \alpha \cdot \epsilon \in x \cdot \left(u+ \frac{vyd}{x} \right) + \sqrt{d} \cdot \Q. \]
		Deduce that
			\[ u+ \frac{vyd}{x} \leq u \left( 1 - \sqrt{1-\frac{N}{x^2}} \right).\]

		\item Prove that, whenever
			\[ x \geq \sqrt{\frac{N \cdot u}{2}}, \]
		one has
			\[ u+ \frac{vyd}{x} < 1. \]

		\item Conclude that the solutions of $\eqref{eq:1}$ each belong to an orbit $\{ \pm \alpha \epsilon^n \ | \ n \in \Z \}$, where $N(\epsilon)=1$, and $\alpha = x + y\sqrt{d}$ gives a solution to $\eqref{eq:1}$ which verifies $\sqrt{N} \leq x < \sqrt{\frac{N \cdot u}{2}}$.
		
		\item Express all integer solutions to the equation
			\[ x^2 - 5y^2 = 11. \]
	\end{enumerate}
