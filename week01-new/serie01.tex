\exercise{ 
	Let $\alpha \in \R\setminus\Q$. Deduce from Dirichlet's theorem that there exist infinitely many $p \in \Z, q\in \N$ such that
		\[ | \alpha - \frac{p}{q} | < 1/q^2. \] 
} {}

\exercise{
	Show that, for any $n \in \N$ which is not a perfect square, $α = \sqrt{n} \in \R\setminus\Q$, and that one always has
		\[ | \alpha - \frac{p}{q} | > \frac{1}{(2 \alpha+1) q^2}. \]
}
{}

\exercise{
	Show that the sequence $\{\cos(n)^n\}_{n\geq1}$ does not converge to $0$.
      }
{
	The goal is to show that there exist infinitely many $n$ such that $\cos(n)$ is sufficiently close to $1$ in order to break the influence of the $n$-th power.
	
	Notice first that
		\[ | 1 - \cos^n(n) | = | 1 - \cos(n) | \cdot |1 + \cos(n) + \cos^ 2(n) + \dots + \cos^{n-1}(n)| \leq  n  | 1 - \cos(n) |, \]
	which means that it is enough to bound $| 1 - \cos(n) |$ by eg. $\frac{1}{2n}$, for infinitely many $n$.

	To this end, consider Dirichlet's theorem and its consequence given by exercise 2.
	Pick $\alpha = 2\pi$, such that there exist infinitely many $p, q$ verifying
		\[ | 2\pi q - p | < \frac{1}{q}. \]
	While $p$ is close to a multiple of $2\pi$, $\cos(p)$ must be close to $1$.
	Indeed, the mean value theorem gives
		\[ |\cos(p) - 1 | = |\cos(p) - \cos(2\pi q)| \leq |\sin(u)| \cdot |p - 2\pi q| \leq \frac{1}{q} |\sin(u)|, \]
	for some real $u$ between $p$ and $2\pi q$.

	The same argument yields
		\[ |\sin(u)| = |\sin(u) - \sin(2\pi q)| \leq |u - 2\pi q| \leq |p - 2\pi q| \leq \frac{1}{q}. \]

	Noticing that $p/q$ is close to $2 \pi$, say $p/q \leq 7$, we get
		\[  | 1 - \cos^p(p) | \leq p  | 1 - \cos(p) | \leq \frac{p}{q^2} \leq \frac7q, \]
	which concludes.
}

\exercise{
  Let $ 1 + ∑_{i=1}^∞ a_i 2^{-i}$, where  $a_i ∈ \{0,1\}$ for each $i$, be the binary representation of $\sqrt{2}$.  Show that there exists a constant $c ∈ ℕ_+$ such that, for all $i ∈ ℕ$, the subsequence $a_i,\dots, a_{c ⋅i}$ cannot consists entirely of ones.  
}{
	Suppose, by contradiction, that for all constants $c \in \N$, there exists an $i \in \N$ such that the subsequence $a_i, \dots, a_{c \cdot i}$ consists entirely of ones.
	\[ \sqrt{2} = 1.\ [...] \ \underbrace{ 1 \cdots \cdots 1 }_{i, \dots, c\cdot i} \ [...] \ \]
	The goal is to show that replacing the bits after $a_i$ and replacing them by $2^{-(i-1)} = 2^{-i + 1}$ gives a good rational approximation of $\sqrt{2}$.

	To that end, we let $p/q = \sum_{0 \leq k \leq i-1} a_k 2^{-k} + 2^{-i + 1}$, and find that $q = 2^{i-1}$, $p=1 + \sum_{0 \leq k \leq i-1} a_k 2^{i-1-k}$ work.
	We will hence achieve a contradiction if the approximation $p/q$ of $\sqrt{2}$ is much better than $1/q$.

	Straightforward computations yield
	\begin{align*}
		| \sqrt{2} - p/q | = 2^{-i + 1} - \sum_{k \geq i} a_k 2^{-k} &\leq 2^{-i + 1} - \sum_{k=i}^{c \cdot i} 2^{-k}, \\
													&= 2^{-i + 1} - (2^{-i + 1} - 2^{-c \cdot i}), \\
													&= \frac{1}{(2q)^c}.
	\end{align*}
	By exercise 3, taking $c=2$ already yields a contradiction.
}

\exercise{
	Compute the first $4$ convergents of $\sqrt{2}$. Show that they are its first best rational approximations.
}{
	We begin by taking the integer part $\lfloor \sqrt{2} \rfloor = 1$, which yields the first approximation $p_0 / q_0 = 1/1$.

	Next, we let $\alpha$ be such that $\sqrt{2} = 1 + \frac{1}{\alpha}$, and continue the process with $\alpha$.
	Routing computation yields $\alpha = \sqrt{2} + 1$, which has integer part $2$.
	One thus has
		\[ p_1 / q_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}. \]
	
	Redefine $\alpha$ once again such that
		\[ \sqrt{2} + 1= 2 + \frac{1}{\alpha}, \]
	which once again yields $\alpha = \sqrt{2}+1$.

	The next approximation is thus
		\[ p_2/q_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{7}{5}. \]
	Alternatively, we easily identify that $a_n=2$ for all $n \geq 1$, which gives the following table, using the recursion formulas seen in class.
