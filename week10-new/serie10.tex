\exercise{
	Let $\alpha \in \R^n$, and fix $N=2^n$, the number of sign vectors $\{\pm1\}^n$.

	Show, using the pigeonhole principle, that there exists a vector $y \in \{ 0, \pm 1\}^n \setminus \{ 0\}$ such that
		\[ | y^T \alpha | \leq \frac{\| \alpha \|_1 }{N - 1}. \]
}{}

\exercise{
	Let $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \in \R^n$ be \emph{badly approximable}, that is there exists a constant $c > 0$ such that
		\[ \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty > \frac{c}{q^{1/n}}, \]
	for all integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$.

	The goal of this exercise is to evaluate the signed sum $| y^T \alpha |$ from below, where $y \in \{ \pm 1 \}^n$.

	Consider the lattice $\Lambda$, dependent on a real quantity $Q > 0$,
		\[ \Lambda \df \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{Q^{n+1}} & 0^T \\
								\alpha & I_n \end{pmatrix} \cdot \Z^{n+1}, \]
	with successive minima $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_{n+1}$.
	
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item 
		Show that, for all $\epsilon > 0$, one has
			\[ \frac{1}{Q^{1 + \epsilon}} \leq \lambda_1 \leq \frac{1}{Q}, \]
		for all $Q \geq c^{-1/\epsilon}$ large enough. Crude bounds are enough here.
		
		\item 
		Let $\epsilon = \frac1{2n}$. Deduce from Minkowski's second theorem that $\lambda_{n+1}$ is vanishing in $Q$, and that one may find $q \geq 1$, $p \in \Z^n$ such that
			\[ \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty^ \leq \frac{1}{2n}, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad y^T p \neq 0, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad q \leq \frac{(n+1)^{n^2 + 3n}}{c^{2n^2}}. \]
		
		\item
		Conclude that 
			\[ | y^T \alpha | \geq \frac{1}{2q} \geq \frac{c^{2n^2}}{2n^{n^2 + 3n}} . \]
	\end{enumerate}

\exercise{
	Let $\alpha \in \R^n$ be a subspace-defining normal which splits the hypercube.
	That is, $\alpha^T x > 0$ or $\alpha^T x < 0$ for each $x \in \{0,1\}^n$.

	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item Find the right lattice on which the LLL algorithm outputs integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$ such that
		\begin{gather*}
			q \leq 2^{n^2 + n \log(n) + 2n}, \\
			\| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{1}{2n}.
		\end{gather*}
		Deduce that, whenever $p^T x \neq 0$, one has ${\rm sign}(\alpha^T x) = {\rm sign}(p^Tx)$.
		
		\item
		In the case that $p^T x \neq 0$, find the constant $M$ such that the vector
			\[ v = M\cdot p + \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ v' \end{pmatrix} \]
		still verifies ${\rm sign}(\alpha^T x) = {\rm sign}(v^Tx)$ for any $\| v' \|_\infty \leq 2^{n^2}$.
