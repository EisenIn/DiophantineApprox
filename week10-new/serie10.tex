\exercise{
	Let $\alpha \in \R^n$, and fix $N=2^n$, the number of sign vectors $\{\pm1\}^n$.

	Show, using the pigeonhole principle, that there exists a vector $y \in \{ 0, \pm 1\}^n \setminus \{ 0\}$ such that
		\[ | y^T \alpha | \leq \frac{\| \alpha \|_1 }{N - 1}. \]
}{
	Consider the set of all signed sums $|s^T\alpha|$ for $s \in \{ \pm 1\}^n$.
	They all belong in the interval $\left[- \|\alpha\|_1, \| \alpha \|_1 \right]$, which we may split uniformly into $N-1$ pieces of size
		\[ \frac{2 \| \alpha \|_1}{N-1} \]
	in order to guarantee that two signed sums belong to the same interval.

	By pigeonhole, there exist $s_1 \neq s_2$ such that
		\[ | s_1^T \alpha - s_2^T \alpha| \leq \frac{2 \| \alpha \|_1}{N-1}. \]
	Denote $y = (s_1 - s_2)/2 \in \{ 0, \pm1\}^n \setminus \{ 0\}$ which concludes.



}

\exercise{
	Let $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \in \R^n$ be \emph{badly approximable}, that is there exists a constant $c > 0$ such that
		\[ \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty > \frac{c}{q^{1/n}}, \]
	for all integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$.

	The goal of this exercise is to evaluate the signed sum $| y^T \alpha |$ from below, where $y \in \{ \pm 1 \}^n$.

	Consider the lattice $\Lambda$, dependent on a real quantity $Q > 0$,
		\[ \Lambda \df \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{Q^{n+1}} & 0^T \\
								\alpha & I_n \end{pmatrix} \cdot \Z^{n+1}, \]
	with successive minima $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_{n+1}$ with respect to the $l^\infty$ norm.
	
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item 
		Show that, for all $\epsilon > 0$, one has
			\[ \frac{1}{Q^{1 + \epsilon}} \leq \lambda_1 \leq \frac{1}{Q}, \]
		for all $Q \geq c^{-1/\epsilon}$ large enough. Crude bounds are enough here.
		
		\item 
		Let $\epsilon = \frac1{2n}$. Deduce from Minkowski's second theorem that $\lambda_{n+1}$ is vanishing in $Q$, and that one may find $q \geq 1$, $p \in \Z^n$ such that
			\[ \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty^ \leq \frac{1}{2n}, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad y^T p \neq 0, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad q \leq \frac{(n+1)^{n^2 + 3n}}{c^{2n^2}}. \]
		
		\item
		Conclude that 
			\[ | y^T \alpha | \geq \frac{1}{2q} \geq \frac{c^{2n^2}}{2n^{n^2 + 3n}} . \]
	\end{enumerate}

}
{
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item Suppose towards contradiction that 
			\[ \lambda_1 < \frac{1}{Q^{1+\epsilon}}. \]
		In that case, a shortest vector of $\Lambda$ with coordinates $(q, p) \in \N \times Z^n$ verifies
			\begin{gather*}
				q \leq Q^n, \\
				\| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{1}{Q^{1+\epsilon}}.
			\end{gather*}
		Using the assumptions that $\alpha$ is badly approximable with constant $c$, we get
			\[ \frac{c}{Q} \leq \frac{c}{q^{1/n}} \leq \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{1}{Q^{1+\epsilon}}, \]
		which implies that $Q \leq c^{-1/\epsilon}$.

		\item Minkowski's second theorem gives
			\[ \lambda_1^n \lambda_{n+1} \leq \prod_{i=1}^{n+1} \lambda_i \leq \frac{(n+1)^{n+1}}{Q^{n+1}}, \]
		which implies that, using i),
			\[ \lambda_{n+1} \leq \frac{(n+1)^{(n+1)/2}}{Q^{1-n\epsilon}} = \frac{(n+1)^{n+1}}{Q^{1/2}}. \] 

		For $Q = \max\{ c^{-2n}, (2n)^2 (n+1)^{n+1}\} \leq c^{-2n} \cdot (2n)^2 (n+1)^{n+1}$, we get that 
			\[ \lambda_{n+1} \leq \frac1{2n}. \]
		Since $n+1$ linearly independent vectors are this small, the coordinates of at least one must verify $p^T y \neq 0$.
		
		We hence get integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$ such that
			\begin{gather*}
				q \leq Q^n \leq \frac{(n+1)^{n^2 +3n}}{c^{2n^2}}, \\
				\| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac1{2n}.
			\end{gather*}

		\item We conclude that
			\[ | q y^T \alpha - y^T p | \leq \frac12, \]
		by the triangle inequality. And since $y^Tp \in \Z^*$, we must have
			\[ q | y^T \alpha | \geq \frac12. \]
		Finally,
			\[ | y^T \alpha | \geq \frac1{2q} \geq \frac{c^{2n^2}}{2n^{n^2+3n}}. \]
	\end{enumerate}

\exercise{
	Let $\alpha \in \R^n$ be a subspace-defining normal which splits the hypercube.
	That is, $\alpha^T x > 0$ or $\alpha^T x < 0$ for each $x \in \{0,1\}^n$.

	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item Find the right lattice on which the LLL algorithm outputs integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$ such that
		\begin{gather*}
			q \leq 2^{n^2 + n \log(n) + 2n}, \\
			\| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{1}{2n}.
		\end{gather*}
		Deduce that, whenever $p^T x \neq 0$, one has ${\rm sign}(\alpha^T x) = {\rm sign}(p^Tx)$.
		
		\item
		In the case that $p^T x \neq 0$, find the constant $M$ such that the vector
			\[ v = M\cdot p + \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ v' \end{pmatrix} \]
		still verifies ${\rm sign}(\alpha^T x) = {\rm sign}(v^Tx)$ for any $\| v' \|_\infty \leq 2^{n^2}$.
