\exercise{ Let $α = \sqrt{d}$ where $d ∈ ℕ_+$ is not a perfect square. We consider the field $ℚ(α) = \{ x + y α ： x, y ∈ℚ \}$.  The \emph{norm} of an element $x +  y α ∈ ℚ(α)$ is defined as
  \begin{displaymath}
    N(x +  y α) = (x +  y α)(x -  y α). 
  \end{displaymath}
  Show $\Q(\alpha)$ is indeed a field, and that the norm is multiplicative, i.e. that one has
  \begin{displaymath}
    N(u⋅v) = N(u)⋅N(v) \text{ for each } u,v ∈ℚ(α). 
  \end{displaymath}

{\bigskip \noindent  \small \emph{ Hint: Show that the map $φ: ℚ(α) → ℚ(α)$, $φ( x + y α ) =  x - y α $ is an isomorphism (endomorphism) of $ℚ(α)$.} }
}
{
	The norm of an element of the field may be understood as the determinant of its multiplication matrix (in any basis).
	Indeed, take $\alpha = x + y \sqrt{d}$, and write the multiplication by $\alpha$ matrix in the basis $\{ 1, \sqrt{d} \}$
	\[
		[ \times \alpha ] = \begin{pmatrix} x & d y \\ y & x \end{pmatrix},
	\]
	which has determinant $x^2 - d y^2$.

	By commutativity of the field, the multiplication maps commute, which yields
		\[
		N(u \cdot v) = \det([ \times (u \cdot v) ]) = \det( [\times u] \cdot [\times v] ) = N(u) \cdot N(v), \]
	as required.

}

\exercise{Find a nontrivial  solution to the Pell equation $x^2 - 5 y^2 =1$, $x,y ∈ ℤ$.}{}

\exercise{Suppose $d ∈ℕ_+$ is not a perfect square such that $d ≡ 3 \pmod{4}$. Show that $ℤ[\sqrt{d}]$ has no units of norm $-1$. }
{
	If an element $x+y\sqrt{d} \in \Z[\sqrt{d}]$ has norm $-1$, then one has
		\[ x^2 + y^2 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}. \]
	Since squares have residue 0 or 1 mod 4, this equation admits no solution.
}


\exercise{Let $d ∈ ℕ_+$ be not a perfect square. The \emph{fundamental unit} of $ℤ[\sqrt{d}]$ is the smallest (as number in $ℝ$) unit $x + y \sqrt{d}$ of $ℤ[\sqrt{d}]$ with $x,y ∈ℕ_+$.

\bigskip 

\noindent
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item 
  Show that the fundamental unit exists and that it is uniquely defined.
\item Show that the fundamental unit is the smallest $ε>1$ in $ℤ[\sqrt{d}]$ such that $|N(ε)| =  1$. 
\end{enumerate}
}{
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item
		By exercise 1 of set 3, there exist infinitely many solutions of the equation $N(\alpha) = k, \alpha \in \Z[\sqrt{d}]$ for some integer $k < 1 + 2\sqrt{d}$.
			As such, there must exist two elements $\alpha, \beta \in \Z[\sqrt{d}]$ with coordinates in the basis $\{1, \sqrt{d}\}$ congruent mod $k$.

		One then verifies that $\frac1k \alpha \bar{\beta} \in \Z[\sqrt{d}]$, which concludes, since
			\[  N\left(\frac1k \alpha \bar{\beta}\right) \in \Z[\sqrt{d}] = \frac1{k^2} N(u) N(v) = 1. \]

		The uniqueness is then given by the fact that 1 and $\sqrt{d}$ are linearly independent over $\Q$.
		\item
		Let $\alpha = x + y\sqrt{d}$ be the fundamental unit of $\Z[\sqrt{d}]$. Clearly, $\alpha > 1$, since both $x$ and $y$ are positive.
		To conclude, it suffices to show that $\alpha$ is a unit if and only if $| N(\alpha) | = 1$.

		On one hand, if $\alpha$ is a unit, then $N(\alpha) N(\alpha^{-1}) = N(1) = 1$, which means that $N(\alpha)$ is a unit of $\Z$, ie. $\pm1$.

		On the other hand, if $N(\alpha)=1$, then $\alpha \bar{\alpha} = 1$, where $\bar{\alpha} = x - y \sqrt{d} \in \Z[\sqrt{d}]$.
	\end{enumerate}
}

\exercise{ Let $d ∈ ℕ_+$ be not a perfect square and let $ε$ be the fundamental unit of $ℤ[\sqrt{d}]$. Show that $G = \{ \pm ε ^z ： z ∈ℤ\}$  is precisely the group of units of $ℤ[\sqrt{d}]$.

  \bigskip
  
  \noindent
  Describe all solutions to the Pell equation. 
}
{
	Let $\alpha = x + y\sqrt{d}$ be a unit of $Z[\sqrt{d}]$. We show that $\alpha$ belongs to $G$.

	We may write $x - y\sqrt{d}, -x + y\sqrt{d}$, and $-x - y\sqrt{d}$ as $\pm \alpha^{-1}$ and $-\alpha$, so that we may suppose $x, y \geq 0$.

	The case $x=1, y=0$ corresponds to $n=0$ in $G$, which lets us assume that $\alpha > 1$.

	There therefore exists an $n \geq 1$ such that
		\[ \epsilon^n \leq \alpha < \epsilon^{n+1}, \]
	by minimality of $\epsilon$.

	This means that $1 \leq \alpha \epsilon^{-n} < \alpha$. 
	By exercise 4ii), one must have $\alpha = \epsilon^n$, which concludes.
}



\exercise{
  Show the following variant of Liouville's Theorem:

  \bigskip 
  
  \noindent  
    Suppose that $α∈ ℝ$ is an non-zero algebraic number of degree $\mathbf{d ≥1}$. There exists a positive constant $c_α>0$ such that for each $(p,q) ∈ ℤ×ℕ_+$ with $\gcd(p,q) = 1$ one has
  \begin{displaymath}
    |α - p/q| > c_α/q^d. 
  \end{displaymath}
\smallskip 
\noindent 
\emph{Hint: Only the case when $α$ is rational needs to be considered, because of Liouville's original theorem.}
