\exercise{
	Let $\mathcal{C} \subset \R^n$ be a \emph{compact}, convex set symmetric about the origin such that
		\[ {\rm vol}(\mathcal{C}) \geq 2^n.\]
	Show that $\mathcal{C}$ must containt a non-zero integer point.
}
{
	Consider the sequence of nested sets $S_k \df (1+\frac1k) \mathcal{C} \subseteq  2 \mathcal{C}$ for $k \geq 1$.
	
	Since ${\rm vol}(S_k) > 2^n$, Minkowski's theorem holds: there exists at least one non-zero integer point in each $S_k$, $k\geq1$.

	As $2 \mathcal{C}$ is bounded, the sequence is uniformly bounded. 
	Therefore, there must exist a non-zero integer point $p$ belonging in infinitely many sets $S_k$.
	As such, $p$ must belong, in the limit, in the closure $\overline{\mathcal{C}} = \mathcal{C}$.

\exercise{
	Let $\mathcal{C} \subset \R^n$ be a convex set symmetric about the origin, and $A \in \R^{n \times n}$.
	Show that the set

	is also convex, symmetric about the origin.

\exercise{
	  This exercise shows that the bound on $q≤ Q^n$  in Dirichlet's theorem is essentially tight.
	To this end, let $Q ∈ ℕ_+$ be an arbitrary integer.
	A tuple $(q,p_1,\dots,p_n) ∈ ℤ^{n+1}$ is said to \emph{cover} $α ∈ ℝ^n$ if $| q⋅α_i - p_i | ≤ 1/Q$ holds for each $i$. 
	We call $q$ the \emph{cost} of the tuple $(q,p_1,\dots,p_n) ∈ ℤ^{n+1}$. 
	  \begin{enumerate}
	  \item Let $S = \{ α ∈ ℝ^n ： α \text{ covered by } (q,p_1,\dots,p_n)\}$. Show that ${\rm vol}(S) = \left( 2 / ( q ⋅ Q)\right)^n$.
	  \item Let  $α ∈ ℝ^n$ satisfy  $\|α\|_∞ ≤1$. If $α$ is covered by a tuple of cost $q$, then  $α$ is covered by a tuple  $(q,p_1,\dots,p_n) ∈ ℤ^{n+1}$  satisfying  $|p_i| ≤ q$ for each $i$. 
	  \item Use a covering argument to show that there exists $α ∈ [-1,1]^n$ that is not covered by any tuple $(q,p_1,\dots,p_n) ∈ ℤ^{n+1}$  of cost  $q< (Q/2)^n$.
	\item Derive a lower bound on ${\rm vol} (K)$ where 
	  \begin{displaymath}
	    K = \{α ∈ [-1,1]^n ： α \text{ not covered with cost } ≤ (Q/4)^n\}.

The following lemma is taken from Drmota, Tichy.  \emph{Sequences, discrepancies and applications}. Springer, 2006. Section 1.4.
\begin{lemma}[Khintchine's transference principle]\label{lem:1}
	Let $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \in \R^n$ such that $1, \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ are linearly independent over $\Q$.
	The following properties are equivalent.
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item For every $c_1 > 0$, there are infinitely many integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$ with
			\[ \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{c_1}{q^{1/n}}. \]
		\item For every $c_2 > 0$, there are infinitely many integers $x \in \Z^n, y \in \Z$ with
			\[ | x^T \alpha - y | \leq \frac{c_2}{ \| x \|_\infty^n}. \]
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\exercise{
	The goal of this exercise is to show Khintchine's transference principle (lemma \ref{lem:1}) between the two versions of Dirichlet's theorem.

	First assume that i) is true, and consider integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$ with
		\[ \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{c_1}{q^{1/n}}, \]
	and define the lattice 
		\[ \Lambda := \begin{pmatrix} q^{\frac{n+1}n} & q^{1/n} p^T \\ 0 & I_n \end{pmatrix} \cdot \Z^{n+1}.\]

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that there exist integers $x \in \Z^n, y \in \Z$ with
			\[ \| x \|_\infty \leq q^{1/n}, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad qy = x^Tp.\]
		\item Deduce that, for these integers,
			\[  \| x \|_\infty^n \cdot | x^T \alpha - y | \leq n \cdot c_1. \]
		\item Conclude that ii) must hold using the linear independence of $\alpha$ over $\Q$.
	\end{enumerate}

	Next, assume that ii) is true, and let $x \in \Z^n, y \in \Z$ with
		\[ | x^T \alpha - y | \leq \frac{c_2}{ \| x \|_\infty^n}, \]
	and define the lattice 
		\[ \Lambda := \begin{pmatrix}
					y & x_1 & \dots & x_{n_1} & x_n \\
					(Qc)\cdot\alpha_1 & & & & \\
					\vdots & & (Qc) \cdot I_{n-1} & & 0 \\
					(Qc)\cdot\alpha_{n-1} & & & & \\
					 \frac{1}{Q^n c^{n-1}} & & 0^T & & 0 
					\end{pmatrix} \cdot \Z^{n+1},\]
	where $Q := \| x \|_\infty = x_n$ without loss of generality, and $c > 1$ is a constant that will be chosen later.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that there exist integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$ verifying
			\[ | q \alpha_i - p_i | \leq \frac{1}{cQ}, \ \forall i=1, \dots, n-1, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad qy = x^Tp, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad q \leq Q^n c^{n-1}. \]
		\item Deduce that 
			\[ |q|^{1/n} \cdot | q \alpha_i - p_i | \leq \frac{1}{c^{1/n}}, \ \forall i=1, \dots, n-1 \qquad \text{ and } \qquad Q | q \alpha_n - p_n| \leq c_2 c^{n-1} + (n-1)\frac1c.\]
		\item Pick $c = c_2^{-1/n}$ and conclude that i) must hold with $c_1 = n \cdot c_2^{1/n^2}.$
	\end{enumerate}
}

\exercise{
	Let $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \in \R^n$. We say that $\alpha$ is \emph{badly approximable} if there exists a constant $c > 0$ such that
		\[ \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty > \frac{c}{q^{1/n}}, \]
	for all integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$.

	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item Show that if $\alpha \in \R^n$ is badly approximable, then $1, \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ are linearly independent over $\Q$.
		\item Suppose that $\alpha \in \R$ is an algebraic integer of degree $n+1$. That is, there exist integers $a_0, \dots, a_{n} \in \Z$ such that
			\[ \alpha^{n+1} + a_{n} \alpha^{n} + \dots +  a_{0} = 0. \]
		Define $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{n+1}$ the $n+1$ conjugate roots of the above polynomial.
		Show that the vector $(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \in \R^n$ is badly approximable using lemma \ref{lem:1}ii).

		\emph{Hint: algebraic integers form a ring. Hence $x^T \alpha$ is also an algebraic integer for $x \in \Z^n$.}
	\end{enumerate}
}
{
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item Notice that the direction ii) $\implies$ i) of exercise 4 does not use the linear independence of $1, \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ over $\Q$.
			In fact, given $x \in \Z^n \setminus \{0\}$, $y\in\Z$ such that $x^T \alpha -y = 0$, one may find integers $q \geq 1, p\in\Z^n$ such that
				\[ \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{c_1}{q^{1/n}}, \]
			where $c_1$ is as small as required. 
			This contradicts the assumption that $\alpha$ is badly approximable.

		\item By the hint, $x^T\alpha - y$ is an algebraic integer of degree $n+1$ for each $x \in \Z^n \setminus \{0\}, y\in\Z$.
			Fix $M = \max\{ | \alpha_1|, \dots, | \alpha_{n+1} |\}$, and consider the norm of $x^T\alpha - y$.

			By Galois theory, the norm is integer, and given by the product over all images by the Galois group automorphisms of the field extension.
			Since the automorphism only permute the roots, sending one conjugate of $\alpha$ to another, we get
				\[ | \sigma(x^T\alpha - y) | = | \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \sigma(\alpha_i) - y | \leq n \| x \|_\infty M + |y| \leq \| x \|_\infty \left( 1 + 2 n M \right), \]
			where we've used that $|y| \leq (1 + nM)\|x \|_\infty$ whenever $| x^T\alpha - y| \leq 1$. 
		
				\[ | N(x^T \alpha - y) | = | x^T \alpha - y | \cdot \prod_{\sigma \neq id} | \sigma(x^T\alpha - y) | \leq | x^T \alpha - y |  \cdot \| x \|_\infty^n ( 1 + 2 n M)^n. \]
			To conclude, we use that the norm is a non-zero integer, by linear independence and the fact that it is an algebraic integer.
			This implies $| N(x^T \alpha - y) | \geq 1$, and shows that Lemma~\ref{lem:1}ii) cannot hold for $c$ small enough.
