\exercise{
	Let $d \in \N$ be a non square integer. Show that the equation
		\[ x^2 - dy^2 = N \]
	admits infinitely many integer solutions $(x,y)$ for some integer $N < 1 + 2 \sqrt{d}$.
}

\exercise{
	Let $\alpha \in \R\setminus\Q$. Show that if integers $p, q$ verify
		\[ | q \alpha - p | < \frac{1}{2q}, \]
	then $p/q$ is a best approximation of $\alpha$.
}

\exercise{
	Consider the expansion $\alpha = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$ of some $\alpha \in \R\setminus\Q$, with convergents $\{p_{k}/q_{k}\}_k$ given by the truncated expansion \footnote{Recall we also defined $p_{-1} := 1$, and $q_{-1} := 0$.}.

	Define $x_k := [a_k; a_{k+1} \dots]$ for each $k\geq0$. Show that the sequence $\{x_k\}_k$ verifies
		\[ x_k = a_k + \frac{1}{x_{k+1}}, \]
	and that one has, for all $k\geq0$, 
		\[ \alpha = \frac{x_{k+1}p_k + p_{k-1}}{x_{k+1}q_k + q_{k-1}}. \]
}

\exercise{
	Consider the expansion $\alpha = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$ of some $\alpha \in \R\setminus\Q$.

	We say that the expansion of $a$ is \emph{eventually periodic} if there exist distinct integers $m, n$, such that
		\[ a_{m+k} = a_{n+k} \]
	for all $k\geq0$.

	Show, using the previous exercise, that if the expansion of $\alpha$ is eventually periodic, then $\alpha$ must be a quadratic irrationality (that is, the root of a degree 2 polynomial with integer coefficients).
}

\exercise{
	The following exercise will show the converse of exercise 4.
	That is, all quadratic irrationalities $\alpha \in \R\setminus\Q$ admit eventually periodic expansions.
	
	Suppose to that end that there exist some $a, b \in \Q$ such that
		\[ \alpha^2 + a \alpha + c = 0. \]

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Argue that it is enough to show that, in the notation of exercise 3, $x_n = x_m$ for two distinct integers $n, m$.
		\item Using exercise 3, show that the quantity $x_{n+1}$ verifies, for each $n\geq0$,
			\[ Ax_{n+1}^2 + Bx_{n+1} + C = 0, \]
		where
			\begin{align*}
			 A &= p_n^2 + a p_n q_n + b q_n^2,
			\qquad C = p_{n-1}^2 + b q_{n_1}^2 + a p_{n-1}q_{n-1},\\
			 B &= 2p_n p_{n-1} + 2b q_n q_{n-1} + a(p_n q_{n-1} + p_{n-1}q_{n}).
			\end{align*}
		\item Show that $|A|, |C| \leq |a| + 2|\alpha|+1$.
		\item Show that $|B| \leq 6|\alpha| + 3|a| + 2$. (crude bounds are enough here)
		\item Conclude that there exist two distinct integers $n, m$ such that $x_n = x_m$.
	\end{enumerate}
}


\exercise{
  We first recall the definition of best approximation. A fraction $p/q$  with $q ∈ ℕ_+$ and $p ∈ℤ$ is a best approximation of $α$ if for each $r/s$ with $s ∈ ℕ_+$, $s∈ ℤ$ one has: If $r/s ≠ p/q$ and $s ≤ q$, then
  \begin{displaymath}
    | α - p/q | < |α - r/s|.   
  \end{displaymath}

  Suppose that $α$ is not a fraction of the form $p/q$ with $q≤2 ⋅N^2$. 
  Show that there exists an $ε>0$ such that the set of best approximations with denominator bound $N$ of $α$ and those of  $α +ε$ are the same. 
}{}

\exercise{Compute the best approximation of $α = 21/13$ with denominator bounded by $10$.}{}
