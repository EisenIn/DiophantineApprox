\begin{itemize}
\item  Explain how to \emph{expand} a number $α ∈ ℝ \setminus ℚ$ as a continued fraction:
  \begin{displaymath}
    α = ⌊α⌋ + \frac{1}{β}, \, β = 1 / (α  - ⌊α⌋). 
  \end{displaymath}
  Continuing this way:
  \begin{displaymath}
    β = ⌊β⌋ + \frac{1}{γ}, \, γ = 1 / (β  - ⌊β⌋)  
  \end{displaymath}
\item
