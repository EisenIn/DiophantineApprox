\exercise{
	Let $n\geq2$ and $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \in \R^n$ such that $1, \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ are linearly independent over $\Q$.

	We aim to show that for any $0 < \epsilon < \frac{1}{2n}$ the number of integers solutions $q\geq1, p\in\Z^n$ to
		\begin{gather}
			 \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{1}{q^{1/n + \epsilon}} \label{eq:1}
		\end{gather}
	is finite.

	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item Show, using the subspace theorem, that the integer solutions lie on finitely many subspaces of $\Q^{n+1}$.

		\item Consider a subspace $S \subset \Q^{n+1}$ and one of its \emph{unit} normal vector $v \in \Q^{n+1} \setminus\{0\}$.
			Show that, if $(q, p)$ belongs in $S$ and is a solution of \eqref{eq:1}, then
				\[ q \left| v^T \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ \alpha \end{pmatrix} \right| \leq 1, \]
			for $q$ large enough.
		
		\item Conclude that, in each subspace $S \subset \Q^{n+1}$, there are only finitely many solutions of \eqref{eq:1}.
