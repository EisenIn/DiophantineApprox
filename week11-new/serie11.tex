\begin{definition}
	We call $L_1, \dots, L_n$ \emph{independent} linear forms in $n$ variables with real algebraic coefficients if, for some $\alpha_{11}, \dots, \alpha_{nn} \in \R$ algebraic,
		\[ L_i(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \alpha_{i1} x_1 + \dots \alpha_{in} x_n \qquad \text{ for each $i$},\]
	and such that
		\[ \det(L_1, \dots, L_n) := \det \left( \alpha_{ij} \right)_{i,j=1}^n \neq 0. \]
	
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Schmidt, 1989]

	Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer.
	Let $L_1, \dots, L_n$ be linearly independent linear forms in $n$ variables with real algebraic coefficients.
	Let $\epsilon > 0$.

	Then there are proper rational subspaces $S_1, \dots, S_t$ of $\Q^n$
	such that all nonzero integer solutions $x = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$ satisfying 
		\[ \left| L_1(x) \cdots L_n(x) \right| < \frac{ \left| \det(L_1, \dots, L_n) \right|  }{\| x\|_\infty^{\epsilon}} \]
	lie in the union of $S_1, \dots, S_t$.

\end{theorem}

\exercise{\label{ex:1}
	Let $n\geq1$ and $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \in \R^n$ algebraic such that $1, \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ are linearly independent over $\Q$.

	We aim to show that for any $\epsilon > 0$ the number of integers solutions $q\geq1, p\in\Z^n$ to
		\begin{gather}
			 \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{1}{q^{1/n + \epsilon}} \label{eq:1}
		\end{gather}
	is finite.

	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item Show, using the subspace theorem, that the integer solutions lie on finitely many subspaces of $\Q^{n+1}$ (and possibly a ball around $0$).

		\item Consider a subspace $S \subset \Q^{n+1}$ and one of its \emph{unit} normal vector $v \in \Q^{n+1} \setminus\{0\}$.
			Show that, if $(q, p)$ belongs in $S$ and is a solution of \eqref{eq:1}, then
				\[ q \left| v^T \onealpha \right| \leq 1, \]
			for $q$ large enough.
		
		\item Conclude that, in each subspace $S \subset \Q^{n+1}$, there are only finitely many solutions of \eqref{eq:1}.

	\end{enumerate}
}
{
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item
		Define the linear forms $L_1, \dots, L_{n+1}$ depending on variables $x = (q, p_1, \dots, p_n)$ by
			\begin{align*}
			        & L_i(x) = q \beta_i - p_i \quad \text{ for } i = 1, \hdots n \\
			        & L_{n+1}(x) = q.
			\end{align*}
		Then for any vector $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$ satisfying $| q \beta_i - p_i | \leq \frac{1}{q^{1/n + \epsilon}}  \ \ \forall i=1, \dots, n$, 
			    \begin{gather*}
			    | L_1(x) \cdots L_{n+1}(x) | \leq \frac{1}{q^{2 \delta}}, \\
				\| p \|_\infty \leq C q,
			    \end{gather*}
		where $C = \max_i \{ | \beta_i |\}+1$, and  $\delta = \frac{n \epsilon}2 \in (0, 1)$.
	
		For such integer vectors with $\| x \|_\infty > C^{2}$, one thus has
			\[ | L_1(x) \cdots L_{n+1}(x) | \leq \frac{1}{\| x  \|_\infty^\delta}. \] 
	    
		Thus, by the subspace theorem, the integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$ satisfying the relation \eqref{eq:1} lie on the union of finitely many subspaces of $\Q^{n+1}$ and of the $l^\infty$ ball of radius $C^2$.

		\item 
		We know that $v^T \qp = 0$, as $v$ is normal to $S$.
		Hence,
			\begin{align*}
				| q v^T \onealpha | &= | q v^T \onealpha - v^T \qp |, \\
								& = | v^T \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ q\alpha - p \end{pmatrix} |, \\
								&\leq\frac{n}{q^{1/n + \epsilon}} \leq 1, 
			\end{align*}
		where we used that $v$ is unit, and provided that $q$ is large enough.
		Do note that $v^T \onealpha \neq 0$ since $1, \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ were supposed linearly independent over $\Q$.

		\item 
		Point ii) implies that 
			\[ q \leq \left| v^T \onealpha \right|^{-1}, \]
		ie. that there are only finitely many $q$ in the subspace $S$.
	\end{enumerate}
}


\exercise{
	Let $n\geq1$ and $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \in \R^n$ such that $1, \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ are linearly \emph{dependent} over $\Q$.

	Fix an $0 < \epsilon < \frac{1}{n(n-1)}$.
	Show that there exist infinitely many integers $q\geq1, p\in\Z^n$ verfiying
		\begin{gather*}
			 \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{1}{q^{1/n + \epsilon}}.
		\end{gather*}
}
{
	Denote $\beta = (\alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n) \in \R^{n-1}$.
	Without loss of generality, we may find an integer vector $v \in \Z^{n-1}$ such that
		\[ \alpha_1 = v^T \beta. \]

	We show that, by approximating $\beta$, we may approximate $\alpha_1$ as well.
	Dirichlet's theorem gives infinitely many $q \geq 1, \tilde{p} \in\Z^{n-1}$ such that
		\[ \| q \beta - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{1}{q^{1/(n-1)}}. \]
	We now note that $\epsilon$ was chosen such that
		\[ \frac{1}{q^{1/(n-1)}} < \frac{1}{q^{1/n + \epsilon}}, \]
	since $1/n + \epsilon < 1/(n-1)$.

	Let $p = v^T \tilde{p}$. Then
		\[ |q \alpha_1 - p| = |q v^T \beta - v^T \tilde{p}| \leq \frac{\| v \|_1}{q^{1/(n-1)}}. \]
	Finally, notice  that
		\[ \frac{\| v \|_1}{q^{1/(n-1)}} < \frac{1}{q^{1/n + \epsilon}} \]
	as soon as 
		\[ q \geq \| v \|_1^{\left( \frac{1}{n(n-1)} - \epsilon \right)^{-1}}, \]
	which must be true for infinitely many $q$.

	In conclusion, defining $p = (p_1, \tilde{p})$, we have found infinitely many $q \geq 1, p\in\Z^n$ such that
		\[ \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{1}{q^{1/n + \epsilon}}. \]

\exercise{

	Let $n\geq2$ and $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \in \R^n$ algebraic such that $1, \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ are linearly independent over $\Q$. 
	Let $\epsilon>0$.

	Conclude from exercise \ref{ex:1} that there exists a constant $c=c(\alpha, \epsilon) > 0$ such that
		\[ \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty > \frac{c}{q^{1/n + \epsilon}}, \]
	for all integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$.

	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item Deduce \emph{Roth's theorem}: for any algebraic $\alpha \in \R\setminus\Q$ and any $\epsilon>0$, there exists a constant $C=C(\alpha, \epsilon)$ such that
			\[ | \alpha - p/q | \geq \frac{C}{q^{2+\epsilon}} \]
		for all $q\geq1, p\in\Z$.
		
		\item In the notation of exercise 2 of set 10, derive a similar bound on $\lambda_1$ of the type
			\[ \lambda_1 \geq \frac{1}{Q^{1+\delta}} \]
		for some $\delta$ which depends on $\epsilon$.

		\item Pick an adequate $\epsilon = \epsilon(n)$ such that 
			\[ \lambda_{n+1} \leq \frac{1}{Q^{1/2}}. \]
		
		\item Find a lower bound on $|y^T \alpha|$ as a function of $n$ and $c(\alpha, n)$.
			This bound should be singly exponential in $n$.

{
	Exercise \ref{ex:1} says that there exist only finitely many integers $q \geq1, p\in\Z^n$ such that
		\[ \|q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{1}{q^{1/n + \epsilon}}. \]
	In particular, the infimum
		\[ c(\alpha, \epsilon) = \inf_{q, p} \{  q^{1/n + \epsilon} \|q \alpha - p \|_\infty \} \]
	is positive.
	We may divide it by $2$ if we wish to get a strict inequality.

	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item 
		Any $\alpha \in \R \setminus\Q$ is independent to $1$ over $\Q$.
		Applying exercise \ref{ex:1} with $n=1$ gives \emph{Roth's theorem} directly.

		\item
		Suppose that
			$ \lambda_1 < \frac{1}{Q^{1+\delta}} .$
		We will show that $Q < Q_0$ for $Q_0$ to be defined later.
	
		The assumption implies the existence of integers $(q, p) \in \N \times \Z^n$ such that
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{q}{Q^{n+1}} &\leq \frac{1}{Q^{1+\delta}}, \text{ and} \\
			\| q \alpha - p \|_\infty &\leq \frac{1}{Q^{1+\delta}}
		\end{align*}
		In turn, this gives a simultaneous approximation of the algebraic numbers $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$:
		\begin{align*}
			\| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{1}{Q^{1+\delta}},
		\end{align*}

		The definition of $c=c(\alpha, \epsilon)$ implies that, choosing $\delta = n \epsilon$,
			\[  \frac{c}{Q^{1 + \delta}} \leq \frac{c}{q^{1/n + \epsilon}} \leq  \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty \leq \frac{1}{Q^{1+\delta}}. \]
