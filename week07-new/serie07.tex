\exercise{
	Prove the linear form version of Minkowski's theorem.
	
	Consider a real matrix $A = (a_{ij})_{i,j=1}^n$ and real numbers $c_1, \dots, c_n \geq 0$. The system of inequalities
	\begin{gather*}
		\left| \sum_{j=1}^n a_{1j} x_j \right| \leq c_1, \\
		\left| \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} x_j \right| < c_i, \ \forall i=2, \dots, n.
	\end{gather*}
	admits a non-zero integer solution if $c_1 \cdots c_n \geq | \det(A) |.$
}
{}

\exercise{
	The following exercise shows Lagrange's four square theorem. 
	That is, all integers $n \in \N$ may be written as the sum of four squares.
		
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item Show that it suffices to show the theorem for odd primes $p$.

		\item Show that there are exactly $\frac{p-1}{2}$ perfect squares in $\F_p^\times$.

		\item Deduce, by considering the tuples $(0, p-1), \dots, (\frac{p-1}2, \frac{p-1}2)$, that there exist non-negative integers $a, b \in \N_0$ such that 
			\[ a^2 + b^2 \equiv  1 \mod {p}. \]

		\item Define the hypersphere
			\[ \mathcal{C} \df \{ (x,y,z,w) \in \R^4 \ | \ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 < 2p \}, \]
		and the lattice
			\[ \Lambda \df \begin{pmatrix} p & 0 & a & b \\
										0 & p & -b & a \\
										0 & 0& 1 & 0 \\
										0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}. \]
		Conclude by showing that the shortest nonzero vector $v \in \Lambda \setminus \{ 0 \}$  verifies
			\[ \| v \|_2^2 < 2p, \qquad \text { and } \qquad  \| v \|_2^2  \equiv 0 \mod{p}. \]
	\end{enumerate}
