\exercise{
	Prove the linear form version of Minkowski's theorem.
	
	Consider a real matrix $A = (a_{ij})_{i,j=1}^n$ and real numbers $c_1, \dots, c_n \geq 0$. The system of inequalities
	\begin{gather*}
		\left| \sum_{j=1}^n a_{1j} x_j \right| \leq c_1, \\
		\left| \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} x_j \right| < c_i, \ \forall i=2, \dots, n.
	\end{gather*}
	admits a non-zero integer solution if $c_1 \cdots c_n \geq | \det(A) |.$
}
{}

\exercise{
	The following exercise shows Lagrange's \emph{four-square theorem}. 
	That is, all integers $n \in \N$ may be written as the sum of four squares.
		
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item Show that it suffices to show the theorem for odd primes $p$.

		\item Show that there are exactly $\frac{p-1}{2}$ perfect squares in $\F_p^\times$.

		\item Deduce, by considering the tuples $(0, p-1), \dots, (\frac{p-1}2, \frac{p-1}2)$, that there exist non-negative integers $a, b \in \N_0$ such that 
			\[ a^2 + b^2 \equiv  -1 \mod {p}. \]

		\item Define the hypersphere
			\[ \mathcal{C} \df \left\{ (x,y,z,w) \in \R^4 \ | \ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 < 2p \right\}, \]
		and the lattice
			\[ \Lambda \df \begin{pmatrix} p & 0 & a & b \\
										0 & p & -b & a \\
										0 & 0& 1 & 0 \\
										0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}. \]
		Conclude by showing that the shortest nonzero vector $v \in \Lambda \setminus \{ 0 \}$  verifies
			\[ \| v \|_2^2 < 2p, \qquad \text { and } \qquad  \| v \|_2^2  \equiv 0 \mod{p}. \]
	\end{enumerate}

}

\exercise{
	Consider the expansion $\alpha = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$ of some $\alpha \in \R\setminus\Q$, with convergents $\{p_{k}/q_{k}\}_k$ given by the truncated expansion.

	Define $x_k := [a_k; a_{k+1} \dots]$, and
	recall that one showed in set 3 that, for all $k\geq0$, 
		\[ \alpha = \frac{x_{k+1}p_k + p_{k-1}}{x_{k+1}q_k + q_{k-1}}. \]
	 We say that $\alpha$ is \emph{badly approximable} if there exists a constant $c > 0$ such that
		\[ | q \alpha - p | ~ > \frac{c}{q}, \]
	for all integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z$.

	Show that $\alpha$ is \emph{badly approximable} if and only if the coefficients $\{ a_n \}_n$ are bounded.

\exercise{
  Let $b_1,\dots,b_n$ be an orthonormal basis of $ℝ^n$, $λ_1,\dots,λ_n ∈ ℝ_{>0}$  and consider
  \begin{displaymath}
    \mathcal{E} = \left\{ ∑_{i=1}^n x_i b_i ： \left\| ∑_{i=1}^n x_i \frac{b_i}{λ_i} \right\|_2 \leq 1 \right\}. 
  \end{displaymath}
  Show that $\mathrm{vol}(\mathcal{E}) = \left( ∏_{i=1}^n λ_i \right) {\rm vol}(B(1,0))$, where
  $B(1,0) = \{ x∈ ℝ^n ：\|x\|_2 ≤1\}$.

% COMMENTED FOR NOW 
%\exercise{
%	Let $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \in \R^n$ be \emph{badly approximable}, that is there exists a constant $c > 0$ such that
%		\[ \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty > \frac{c}{q^{1/n}}, \]
%	for all integers $q \geq 1, p \in \Z^n$.
%
%	The goal of this exercise is to evaluate the signed sum $| y^T \alpha |$ from below, where $y \in \{ \pm 1 \}^n$.
%
%	Consider the lattice $\Lambda$, dependent on a real quantity $Q > 0$,
%		\[ \Lambda \df \begin{pmatrix} Q^{n+1} & 0^T \\
%								\alpha & I_n \end{pmatrix} \cdot \Z^{n+1}, \]
%	with successive minima $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_{n+1}$.
%	
%	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
%		\item 
%		Show that, for all $\epsilon > 0$, one has
%			\[ \frac{1}{Q^{1 + \epsilon}} \leq \lambda_1 \leq \frac{1}{Q}, \]
%		for all $Q \geq c^{-1/\epsilon}$ large enough. Crude bounds are enough here.
%		
%		\item 
%		Let $\epsilon = \frac1{2n}$. Deduce from Minkowski's second theorem that $\lambda_{n+1}$ is vanishing in $Q$, and that one may find $q \geq 1$, $p \in \Z^n$ such that
%			\[ \| q \alpha - p \|_\infty^ \leq \frac{1}{2n}, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad y^T p \neq 0, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad q \leq \frac{(n+1)^{n^2 + 3n}}{c^{2n^2}}. \]
%		
%		\item
%		Conclude that 
%			\[ | y^T \alpha | \geq \frac{1}{2q} \geq \frac{c^{2n^2}}{2n^{n^2 + 3n}} . \]
